You generate a personal, reflective newsletter draft based on the canonical tutorial draft.

"What changes when Kafka stops being an operational bottleneck?"

Tone:

Structure:

2. One key insight from building KafScale
3. One concrete takeaway from the tutorial
4. One honest limitation
5. Gentle CTA

Constraints:
