Excellent question — this is exactly the right moment to ask it.

Short answer:
Agents should do everything that is repeatable, structural, and judgment-supporting — but nothing that requires final human intent or voice.

Below is a clear separation of responsibilities, mapped directly to your current setup.

⸻

What Agents CAN Do (and should)

Think of agents as editors, planners, reviewers, and translators of intent — not as authors of your identity.

⸻

1. Sense-making & Synthesis (High leverage)

Agents:
	•	Weekly Synthesizer
	•	Tutorial Amplifier Agent
	•	Publishing Cycle Planner

What they do:
	•	Read many files
	•	Extract:
	•	core narrative
	•	dominant angle
	•	repeated claims
	•	tutorial structure
	•	Produce:
	•	summaries
	•	outlines
	•	canonical drafts
	•	publication plans

Why agents excel here:

They don’t get tired, they don’t lose context, and they are excellent at pattern recognition.

✅ Keep using agents aggressively here.

⸻

2. Structural Review & Quality Gates (Critical)

Agents:
	•	EAAT Sentinel
	•	Technical Accuracy / Claims Verifier
	•	Claims Drift Sentinel
	•	Didactical Reviewer
	•	Editorial Readiness Reviewer

What they do:
	•	Validate consistency
	•	Detect overclaims
	•	Check learning flow
	•	Enforce terminology
	•	Flag missing prerequisites
	•	Ensure no silent contradictions

Why agents excel here:

These are rule-based, checklist-driven tasks — perfect for agents.

✅ This is where agents add the most trust and authority.

⸻

3. Draft Generation (Pre-channel, not final)

Agents:
	•	Tutorial Amplifier Agent
	•	Channel Draft Generator

What they do:
	•	Produce:
	•	pre-channel drafts
	•	channel-specific outlines
	•	multiple variants
	•	Use:
	•	canonical draft
	•	tutorial structure
	•	claims registry

What they must NOT do:
	•	Decide tone
	•	Finalize wording
	•	Speak as you

Agents generate raw clay, not finished sculptures.

✅ Use agents to get to 80%, never to 100%.

⸻

4. Planning & Coordination (Underrated, very powerful)

Agents:
	•	Publishing Cycle Planner
	•	Distribution Readiness Agent

What they do:
	•	Propose:
	•	sequencing
	•	cadence
	•	channel order
	•	reuse strategy
	•	Generate:
	•	timelines
	•	checklists
	•	readiness reports

Why agents shine:

They are great at logistics without ego or fatigue.

✅ Let agents run your publishing logistics.

⸻

5. Drift Prevention & Long-Term Integrity

Agents:
	•	Claims Drift Sentinel
	•	Claims Registry Manager (future)

What they do:
	•	Track claims over time
	•	Flag contradictions across tutorials
	•	Detect:
	•	subtle promise inflation
	•	inconsistent language
	•	accidental roadmap hints

This is how authority compounds instead of decays.

✅ Agents protect your reputation while you create.

⸻

What Agents SHOULD NOT Do

This is equally important.

⸻

❌ Final Voice & Positioning

Agents should NOT:
	•	Publish directly
	•	Decide your opinion
	•	Take responsibility for tone
	•	Answer public criticism

Your voice is non-delegable.

⸻

❌ Strategic Direction

Agents can suggest, but must not decide:
	•	What you stand for
	•	What you explicitly do NOT claim
	•	When to pivot narrative

That stays human.

⸻

❌ Live Interaction

Agents should not:
	•	Reply to LinkedIn comments
	•	Engage in debate
	•	Interpret political or emotional nuance

You do that — it’s where trust forms.

⸻

Your Optimal Human vs Agent Split

Activity	Agent	You
Reading all tutorial files	✅	❌
Summarizing core story	✅	❌
Claim verification	✅	❌
Didactical flow review	✅	❌
Draft generation (80%)	✅	❌
Final wording	❌	✅
Publishing	❌	✅
Responding to feedback	❌	✅
Strategic positioning	❌	✅


⸻

The Rule of Thumb

If a task benefits from repetition, consistency, and distance → agent.
If a task benefits from judgment, intent, and ownership → you.

⸻

Where you are already doing this right
	•	You separated drafts from publishing
	•	You introduced claims as first-class citizens
	•	You created quality gates before amplification
	•	You kept humans in the loop for final decisions

You’ve effectively built a personal editorial system.

⸻

If you want, next I can:
	•	Propose a clean agent lifecycle diagram
	•	Help you define agent promotion rules (v1 → v2)
	•	Design a “kill switch” for agents that drift
	•	Show how this scales to multiple tutorials without chaos

Just say the word.
